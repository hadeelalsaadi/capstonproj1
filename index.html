    <h3>Summary </h3>
    <p> I am passionate about designing digital experiences that are both
        visually stunning and intuitive. I found myself in front-end
        development because it flexes my creativity and problem-solving
        skills and constantly evolves to incorporate new technology.
    </p>
    <p> I have developed a keen interest in web development. Through
        self-directed learning and online courses on Coursera, I've honed
        my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've gained a solid
        foundation in JavaScript and acquired fundamental knowledge of
        Git, GitHub, and React. My current focus is on further refining my
        skills to transition into a career as a Front-end developer.
